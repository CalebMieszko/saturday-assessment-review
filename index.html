    <p>
      Before Sunrise is one of my wife and I's favorite movies, we watched it
      for the first time right around the day we got married. We watched it
      again when we renewed our vows. It's about a couple that meet for one
      night only while on a trip abroad and fall in love for decades, though
      they don't see each other again for a very long time.

      <li>
        Richard Linklater spent nine months casting the film because he saw so
        many people but had trouble finding the right actors for the roles of
        Jesse and CÃ©line.
